# ðŸŽ¬ Source Code for My YouTube Videos

This repository contains the **Manim** source code used to create the animated explainer videos on my YouTube channel â€” focused on **Game Development**, **Engine Design**, and **Low-Level Systems Programming**.

All animations are built using [Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim), the open-source mathematical animation engine.  
Big thanks to the Manim community for making such an incredible tool available!
